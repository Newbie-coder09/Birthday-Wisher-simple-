# Birthday-Wisher-simple-
Modify and share this program to the BDay Boy/Girl.

Birthday Wisher:
This is a very simple program created using a bunch of JLabels.
This program can be modified easily and looks great to a non programmer. 

As soon as the BDay Boy/Girl run this program, it will play a music (Birthday instumental music) and a bunch of text will appear after some seconds like "Happy Birthday" and all. You can change the music, text, time of appearance and many more.

Modify this program, convert it to exe and send it to the BDay Boy/Girl to wish them.

Features:
* GUI looks great.
* Written in very less lines.
* You can change text, music, appearance and add more components (such as a "Thank You" button with link of your Whatsapp).
* And many more.
